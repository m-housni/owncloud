Feature: Upload
  As a user
  I want to upload resources
  So that I can store them in owncloud

  Scenario: Upload resources in personal space
  Given "Admin" creates following users
    | id    |
    | Alice |
  And "Alice" logs in
  And "Alice" opens the "files" app
  And "Alice" creates the following resources
    | resource          | type    | content             |
    | new-lorem-big.txt | txtFile | new lorem big file  |
    | lorem.txt         | txtFile | lorem file          |
    | textfile.txt      | txtFile | some random content |
  When "Alice" uploads the following resources
    | resource          | option    |
    | new-lorem-big.txt | replace   |
    | lorem.txt         | skip      |
    | textfile.txt      | keep both |
  And "Alice" creates the following resources
    | resource           | type    | content      |
    | PARENT/parent.txt  | txtFile | some text    |
    | PARENT/example.txt | txtFile | example text |
  #  currently upload folder feature is not available in playwright
  #  And "Alice" uploads the following resources
  #    | resource |
  #    | PARENT   |
  And "Alice" logs out
