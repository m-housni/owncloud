Feature: Locks
  As a user
  I would like to be able to use locks control deletion of files and folders
  So that I can prevent files and folders being deleted while they are being used by another user

  Background:
    #do not set email, see bugs in https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/32250#issuecomment-434615887
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files in the server:
      | username       |
      | brand-new-user |
    And user "brand-new-user" has created folder "simple-folder" in the server
    And user "brand-new-user" has created file "simple-folder/lorem.txt" in the server
    And user "brand-new-user" has created file "lorem.txt" in the server
    And user "brand-new-user" has logged in using the webUI

  @issue-ocis-1284
  Scenario Outline: deleting a file in a public share of a locked folder
    Given user "brand-new-user" has locked folder "simple-folder" setting the following properties in the server
      | lockscope | <lockscope> |
    And user "brand-new-user" has created a public link with following settings in the server
      | path        | simple-folder                |
      | permissions | read, create, delete, update |
    When the public uses the webUI to access the last public link created by user "brand-new-user" in a new session
    And the user tries to delete folder "lorem.txt" using the webUI
    Then notifications should be displayed on the webUI with the text
      """
      Failed to delete "lorem.txt" - the file is locked
      """
    When the user reloads the current page of the webUI
    Then file "lorem.txt" should be listed on the webUI
    Examples:
      | lockscope |
      | exclusive |
      | shared    |
