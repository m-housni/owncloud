Feature: Autocompletion of share-with names
  As a user
  I want to share files, with minimal typing, to the right people or groups
  So that I can efficiently share my files with other users or groups

  Background:
    Given the setting "shareapi_auto_accept_share" of app "core" has been set to "no" in the server
    And the administrator has set the default folder for received shares to "Shares" in the server
    # Users that are in the special known users already
    And these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files in the server but not initialized:
      | username    |
      | Alice       |
      | Carol       |
      | usergrp     |
      | regularuser |
    # Some extra users to make the share autocompletion interesting
    And these users have been created without initialization and without skeleton files in the server:
      | username  | password  | displayname     | email          |
      | two       | %regular% | Brian Murphy    | u2@oc.com.np   |
      | u444      | %regular% | Four            | u3@oc.com.np   |
      | five      | %regular% | User Group      | five@oc.com.np |
      | usersmith | %regular% | John Finn Smith | js@oc.com.np   |
    And these groups have been created in the server:
      | groupname     |
      | finance1      |
      | finance2      |
      | finance3      |
      | users-finance |
      | other         |

  Scenario: autocompletion of regular existing users

    But only users and groups that contain the string "us" in their name or displayname should be listed in the autocomplete list on the webUI
    And the users own name should not be listed in the autocomplete list on the webUI
