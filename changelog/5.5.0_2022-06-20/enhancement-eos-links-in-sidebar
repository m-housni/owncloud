Enhancement: EOS links insidebar, fix tooltips

We've added a `runningOnEos` setting which, if set to true, displays two entries in the sidebar: 
The EOS path and a direct link to the file. Along with adding the two links, we have also resolved 
an issue with overflowing text/tooltips in the sidebar for very long text.
