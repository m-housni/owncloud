Enhancement: Access right sidebar panels via URL

Opening the right sidebar (including its panels) is now possible via URL param.

For private or internal links it only requires the new `details` param in the URL. For other URLs (e.g. personal space, project space) the `scrollTo` param including the resource id is needed as well.

The following values can be used for the `details` param:

* `details` - sidebar open, no specific panel
* `actions` - actions panel
* `sharing` - share panel
* `versions` - versions panel
* `space-share` - members panel (project space only)
