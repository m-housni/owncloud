Enhancement: Resolve bookmarked public links with password protection

Bookmarks to a public link (e.g. when user navigated into a subfolder and then created a bookmark) or
to an app that was opened from a public link (e.g. photo opened in preview app) now properly resolve
the public link context before loading the bookmarked content. This includes a roundtrip to the
password input prompt for password protected public link, e.g. when a password was set in the first
place, has been changed in the meantime, etc.
