Enhancement: Re-sharing for ocis

We've enhanced web to be able to re-share resources when using an ownCloud infinite scale backend. It now works for project and personal spaces as well as the sharing jail.
Besides that we also send roles, space-ref and path as separate values to the sharing api which simplifies the usage of it.
