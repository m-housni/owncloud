Bugfix: Allow uploads outside of user's home despite quota being exceeded

We've fixed a bug where a user was not able to upload a file in a share or space
when the personal home quota was exceeded.
We also show a message in the upload details if an upload to a share fails because the share owner's
quota is exceeded.
