Enhancement: Don't open right sidebar from private links

We've changed the behaviour of the web ui to not open the right sidebar anymore when the URL contains a "scrollTo" option. We still select the file and scroll it into the view, but opening the right sidebar felt very invasive, so we now leave that choice to the user.
