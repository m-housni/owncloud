Enhancement: Id based routing

We now include fileIds in the URL query to be able to
- resolve files and spaces correctly and
- resolve the correct relative path of a file if it was changed (this might be the case for bookmarks)
The fileIds in the URL can be disabled by setting `options.routing.idBased` to `false` in the `config.json`.

Note: It's recommended to keep the default of fileIds being used in routing. Otherwise it's not possible
to resolve spaces with name clashes correctly.
