Bugfix: Shares loading

We've improved the loading of shares:

* Share loading now happens more globally in the sidebar component instead of in each sidebar panel.
* Shares won't be loaded for resources without a path anymore, which massively increases performance.
* Several issues with (re-)share permissions have been fixed.
* `loadCurrentFileOutgoingShares` and `loadIncomingShares` mutations have been removed. Instead, incoming and outgoing shares are now being loaded via `loadSharesTree()`. This avoids `getShare()` requests from being executed multiple times.
* Space member loading has been decoupled from shares loading in store. This reduces fetching of space members to a minimum and improves the structure of the code.
* Reactive loading of share indicators in sidebar details panel has been fixed.
* Reactive loading of space member count in the spaces overview has been fixed.
* Loading of indirect shares within spaces has been fixed.
