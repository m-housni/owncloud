Change: Merge resource target path with folder path

We've merged the resource target route path with the folder path in the `router-link`.
When passing the path as a parameter, it wasn't being recognised and the navigation just pointed to the target route path.
By explicitly merging them, we make sure that the navigation behaves as expected.
