Change: Pass object as the target route

We've changed the `targetRoute` prop in the `oc-resource` component to accept an object instead of a string.
This object is now accepting keys `name`, `params` and `query`. Only `name` is required.
All keys are then passed to the router link which enables using more complex routes.
