Bugfix: Embed svg images
We've changed the way how svg images get loaded in oc-icon.
Before this, svg images where transformed to data urls by webpack.
Now, we use require to inline them, which prevents the browser from
doing a XMLHttpRequest that can lead to problems with the content-security-police.
