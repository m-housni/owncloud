Bugfix: Update table component in OcIcon docs

The `<oc-table>` component had a breaking change in the *2.1.0* release, 
which broke the [oc-icon component docs](https://owncloud.design/#/oC%20Components/OcIcon).
To fix it we needed to use the new `<oc-table-simple>` component instead, which mimics the behaviour of the old `<oc-table>` component.
